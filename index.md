## Welcome

I am a PhD candidate at the [Dialogue Systems Group](http://mi.eng.cam.ac.uk/research/dialogue/) supervised by [dr. Milica Gašić](https://mi.eng.cam.ac.uk/~mg436) working on long-term conversational agents. I am passionate about everything that is related to machine learning, artificial intelligence, statistics and mathematics. 

Over last two years I worked on Bayesian statistics, variational inference, multivariate time series and copulas.

With [Marta Karaś](https://statsox.github.io/) I created first Polish platform about machine learning [PLML](https://plml17.github.io).

If you have any questions feel free to contact me - my mail is pfb30@cam.ac.uk.
