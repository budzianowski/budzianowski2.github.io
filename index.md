I am a PhD candidate in [Dialogue Systems Group](http://dialogue.mi.eng.cam.ac.uk/index.php/people/) at University of Cambridge working on long-term conversational agents jointly supervised by [dr. Rich Turner](http://learning.eng.cam.ac.uk/Public/Turner/WebHome) and [prof. Anna Korhonen](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~alk23/). Over the last two years, I had a chance to work with [dr. Milica Gašić](https://www.cs.hhu.de/en/research-groups/dialog-systems-and-machine-learning.html).

I am passionate about everything that is related to mathematics, statistics, machine learning and artificial intelligence.
Prior to PhD, I was working on training deep belief networks using high-temperature expansion being supervised by [dr. Rich Turner](http://learning.eng.cam.ac.uk/Public/Turner/WebHome) and advised by [Nilesh Tripuraneni](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~nileshtrip/).

If you have any questions feel free to contact me - my mail is pfb30 at cam.ac.uk.

NEWS:
The slides from the Conversational AI tutorial at EMNLP'19 are [here](https://www.polyai.com/emnlp19/).

I recently gave a couple of talks about recent progress in learning multi-domain dialogues with MultiWOZ including Apple, Facebook and Stanford. See also a new challenge in [DSTC8](https://sites.google.com/dstc.community/dstc8/home) based on MultiWOZ.

Along with the PolyAI crew, we gave a tutorial on the Conversational AI at [PLinML](http://plinml.mimuw.edu.pl/) in Warsaw. Slides and code are [here](https://github.com/budzianowski/plml_convai)!

Our paper with the largest multi-domain task-oriented dataset publicly available has won the best resource paper award at EMNLP! [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.00278) [[code]](https://github.com/budzianowski/multiwoz) [[data]](http://dialogue.mi.eng.cam.ac.uk/index.php/corpus/)

We won the best student paper award at ICASSP 2018 for working on uncertainty estimates in DeepRL! [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.11486), [[code]](https://pydial.org)
