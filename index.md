I am a PhD candidate at the [Dialogue Systems Group](http://mi.eng.cam.ac.uk/research/dialogue/) at University of Cambridge working on long-term conversational agents supervised by [dr. Milica Gašić](https://mi.eng.cam.ac.uk/~mg436). Prior to PhD, I was working on training deep belief networks using high-temperature expansion being supervised by [dr. Rich Turner](http://learning.eng.cam.ac.uk/Public/Turner/WebHome) and advised by [Nilesh Tripuraneni](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~nileshtrip/). I am passionate about everything that is related to mathematics, statistics, machine learning and artificial intelligence.

Currently, my primary focus is to apply hierarchical and efficient off-policy deep reinforcement learning methods to dialogue policy management.

Over last four years I have worked on Bayesian statistics, variational inference, multivariate time series and copulas.

If you have any questions feel free to contact me - my mail is pfb30@cam.ac.uk.

NEWS:

Our paper with the largest multi-domain task-oriented dataset publicly available has been accepted to EMNLP! The data and the paper will be out soon. 

We won best student paper award at ICASSP 2018 for working on uncertainty estimates in deepRL! [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.11486)
