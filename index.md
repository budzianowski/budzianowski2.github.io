I am a PhD candidate at the [Dialogue Systems Group] at University of Cambridge (http://mi.eng.cam.ac.uk/research/dialogue/), supervised by [dr. Milica Gašić](https://mi.eng.cam.ac.uk/~mg436), working on long-term conversational agents. I am passionate about everything that is related to mathematics, statistics, machine learning and artificial intelligence.

Currently, my primary focus is to apply hierarchical and efficient off-policy deep reinforcement learning methods to dialogue policy management.

Over last four years I have worked on Bayesian statistics, variational inference, multivariate time series and copulas.

If you have any questions feel free to contact me - my mail is pfb30@cam.ac.uk.
