Eddie Vedder really does have the most awesome voice around, doesn't he? [Note: I will fight you if you disagree.]<br /><br />Not that he does anything spectacular by his own standards here... But, still, it's just a sublime rendition of this Tom Petty favourite.<br /><br /><iframe width="560" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/0En39L3Y3U4" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe> <br />And with that, back to my DSGE models...
