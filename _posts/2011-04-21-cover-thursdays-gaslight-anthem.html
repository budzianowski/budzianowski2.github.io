The only logical step after last week's Springsteen edition is these fellas. (Well, logic and the fact that I'm still alarmingly short on time just before the Easter break and need to come up with something quickly. Almost time to come up for air.)<br /><br />First, taking on Damien Rice's <i>9 Crimes</i>.<br /><br /><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="349" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/IPLxXQ5Vwhg" title="YouTube video player" width="425"></iframe><br /><br />Second, adding some feeling to Kelly Clarkson's <i>I Do Not Hook Up</i>.<br /><br /><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="349" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/HUgZXTttUTk" title="YouTube video player" width="425"></iframe><br /><br />Apart from being the heir apparent to Bruce, Brian Fallon... er, Gaslight Anthem is a prolific covers band. There's tons of good stuff waiting for you, just a simple youtube or Google search away.
