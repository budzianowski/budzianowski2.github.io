My mate Nic used to run a regular segment over at <u><a href="http://nicrosslee.posterous.com/">his blog</u></a> called "Cover Thursdays". He's since put his musings on the back burner a bit, but I really like what he was trying to do with that... And so, in trying to keep the spirit alive, here are two covers that deserve your listening pleasure:<br /><br />1) Radiohead's <i>The Reckoner</i> by Gnarls Barkley<br /><br /><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="349" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/RUmmsMeHAaE" title="YouTube video player" width="560"></iframe><br /><br />Now, I know that Radiohead fans[*] can be a sensitive bunch, but anyone who tells me that Ce Lo Green wasn't borne to sing this song is a filthy liar. I haven't been this aroused by an overweight black man since Solomon Burke was in his prime.<br /><br />And \(-\) in what may be the most un-PC segue of all time \(-\) since we're on the subject of "large-ish" singers that have got it where it counts, I hand you over to Beth Ditto and co. ...<br /><br />2) Wham!'s <i>Careless Whisper</i> by The Gossip<br /><br /><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="349" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/ybZzx4xs4JU" title="YouTube video player" width="425"></iframe><br /><br /><i>So </i>much better than the original, I honestly don't even know where to start. I wish more bands understood this remarkably simple concept; that a good cover isn't just inserting a new vocalist to <i>exactly </i>the same music. I'd hit the&nbsp;karaoke bars if that's what I wanted, thank you very much.<br /><br /><br /><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: x-small;">[*] I take it most people have seen <u><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHS3ci9H_Uc">the reaction</u></a> to <i>The King of Limbs</i>? I've only listened to a few times and, look, it's certainly no <i>In Rainbows</i> (which was also by far the best thing they've done for over a decade IMHO). So, yes,&nbsp;disappointing&nbsp;after all the hype, but I've still got time for a few tracks. E.g. For all the controversy that surrounded the music video \(-\) I mean, it's Radiohead... What did you expect, a love story? \(-\) I think <i><u><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfOa1a8hYP8">Lotus Flower</u></a></i>&nbsp;is a great tune.</span>
