I had a long video chat with <u><a href="http://www.aguanomics.com/" target="_blank">David Zetland</u></a> yesterday, where we discussed fracking, water pollution, property rights and a bunch of related issues. David's take on our talk is&nbsp;<u><a href="http://www.aguanomics.com/2013/05/fracking-pollution-property-rights-and.html" target="_blank">here</u></a>.<br /><br />Like many people, I find it very difficult to watch/listen to videos of myself. (Where did all those mannerisms come from??) Still, if you've ever wondered what a real South African accent sounds like, you're in for a treat!<br /><br />In related news, the below video will act as supporting evidence for my submission as "the palest man in economics".<br /><br /><a name='more'></u></a><br /><br />&nbsp;  <iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/n8i3b7cfnLg" width="560"></iframe>
