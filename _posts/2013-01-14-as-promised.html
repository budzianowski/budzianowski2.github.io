I've written a <u><a href="http://blogg.nhh.no/reconhub/?p=753" target="_blank">summary of my paper on electricity prices and water scarcity</u></a> over at the <b>Recon Hub</b>. I hope regular readers of this blog will feel inclined to take a look and let me know what they think.<br /><br />The opening gambit goes like so:<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><span>We’ve all seen images like the one above. Indeed, they have become something of a recurring and iconic feature in the climate change debate: The massive towers of a power station stand out ominously against the skyline as thick plumes of CO2 pour into the atmosphere.&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span>Except, of course, that those are just cooling towers. And that “smoke” billowing out at the top isn’t CO2, which is invisible after all. (You don’t see anything when you breathe out.) What we’re actually seeing here is <i>water vapour</i>.</span></blockquote>
