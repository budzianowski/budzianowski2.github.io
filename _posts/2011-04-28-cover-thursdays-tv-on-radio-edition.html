I was giving the new TV on the Radio album, <u><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8B5GP0AiQMc"><i>Nine Type of Light</i></u></a>, a listen/watch yesterday. I like the ambition of the concept...<br /><blockquote><span class="Apple-style-span">Nine Types of Light is as much an album as it is a movie by TV on the Radio. The movie is meant to be a visual re-imagining of the record, and includes a music video for every song on the album. The band personally asked their friends and the filmmakers they admired to help direct the music videos.</span></blockquote>... But have to say that the music left me feeling kinda "meh-ish". (The visual side of things is more impressive. I don't exactly know what the director was going for with /smoking prior to&nbsp;<u><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UeL3XIWBvdc">Second Song</u></a>, but I like it.) To be honest, I'm not sure where this leaves me with the band now. I thought <u><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03hC_Ml8aAM">Wolf Like Me</u></a> was one of the best songs I'd heard in years when it first came out and nothing's changed my mind significantly since. I *liked* <u><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dear_Science"><i>Dear Science</i></u></a>, although the plaudits it received \(-\) multiple 2008 Album of the Year awards \(-\) were rather generous to say the least.&nbsp;(Fave track on the album: <u><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMv_PuGHSGA">Family Tree</u></a>.)<br /><br />So we &nbsp;appear to be on a slight downward trend as far as this music relationship is concerned. I also know that TVotR aren't to everyone's taste as it is. Still, give these covers a listen and see if they move you...<br /><br />First up, The Subways remind us that they're so much more than a simple&nbsp;<i>be-my-be-my-rock-n-rock-queen</i> chorus line, with a perfectly melodic version of "Staring at the Sun":<br /><br /><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="349" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/DXKEf4VwpIQ" width="425"></iframe><br />[Note to video uploader: Good spellint, pal!]<br /><br />Second, here's TVotR themselves taking down the Pixie's&nbsp;<i>Mr Grieves</i>&nbsp;(off the classic <i>Doolittle</i>) in pretty impressive, completely original&nbsp;<i>a cappella</i> fashion.<br /><br /><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="349" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/D1k6dD3WAP0" width="425"></iframe>
