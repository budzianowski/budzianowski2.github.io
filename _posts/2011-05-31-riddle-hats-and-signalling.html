Some of you may know this one already, but a here's a favourite riddle of mine.<br /><br />Four prisoners are blindfolded and arranged as follows: Three of them are lined up one behind the other&nbsp;(i.e. facing the same way), while the last prisoner is placed on the other side of a screen. A hat is then placed on each of their heads.&nbsp;When the blindfolds are removed...<br /><ul><li>Prisoner A can see B and C in front of him, but not D.</li><li>Prisoner B can see C, but neither A or D.&nbsp;</li><li>Prisoners C and D can only see the screen.</li><li>None of them is able to see what colour hat they are wearing themselves.</li></ul><br /><ul></ul><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><u><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-TzfVOI1gvMg/TeTCdD_iZbI/AAAAAAAAAHw/gWzq_fgbspc/s1600/Hats.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="193" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-TzfVOI1gvMg/TeTCdD_iZbI/AAAAAAAAAHw/gWzq_fgbspc/s320/Hats.png" width="320" /></u></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div>The prison warden then announces his beastly scheme:&nbsp;<i>"Each of you has either a red or a blue hat on your head. There are two hats of each colour. One of you will be able to say \(-\) with 99% certainty \(-\) what colour hat you are wearing. Moreover, you should be able to do so within a minute. Should that person call out the correct answer, you are all free to go. Failing that, you are all to be sentenced to death!"</i><br /><br />[Cue: Dramatic music]<br /><br />Which prisoner calls out the correct answer and how is he able to do so without resorting to a 50/50 guess?&nbsp;(Rest assured, this a puzzle of logic and so there are no petty tricks like whispering to each other, turning around, mirrors, peaking over the screen, etc.)<br /><br />Solution below the fold!<br /><a name='more'></u></a><div style="text-align: center;"><br />===</div><br /><br />After a few moments of tense silence, <u>Prisoner B</u> correctly calls out, "<i>I'm wearing a red hat!</i>" And, with that, the warden is grudgingly forced to let the men go free.<br /><br />The trick to solving the puzzle is to realise that a different set-up of hats would make it very easy for someone to give the answer. In particular, Prisoner A <i>would </i>instantly&nbsp;be able to call out the right answer... if only B and C were wearing the same colour hats. However, since they aren't, he is forced to remain silent.<br /><br />Nevertheless, Prisoner B realises this and \(-\) given A's extended silence \(-\) he deduces that he (i.e. B) must be wearing a different colour hat to C. Thus, he simply looks at the colour of C's hat and calls out the opposite!<br /><br />In other words, it is A's silence that provides the crucial clue to B.<br /><br /><b>THOUGHT FOR THE DAY:</b> I thought of this when I saw a Modelled Behaviour <u><a href="http://twitter.com/#!/ModeledBehavior/status/75323184198594560">tweet</u></a> yesterday: "<span class="Apple-style-span">Not signalling can be the ultimate signal</span>".
