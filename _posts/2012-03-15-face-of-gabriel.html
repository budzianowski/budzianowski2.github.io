Jonathan Haid's comments on the spiritual nature of warfare reminded me of a passage in&nbsp;<u><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Corellis-Mandolin-Novel-Louis-Bernieres/dp/067976397X/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1331766092&amp;sr=1-1" style="font-style: italic;" target="_blank">Captain Correli's Mandolin</u></a>&nbsp;by Louis de Berni√®res. The character Mandras is something of tragic figure in the book. A simple fisherman who finds himself transformed by the horrors of war and unable to relate to the loved ones that await his return:<br /><div><blockquote><span>Once, near the Metsovon pass, in December,&nbsp;when it was twenty degrees below zero because there was no cloud, the Italians&nbsp;sent up a starshell. It exploded in a cascade of brilliant blue light against the face&nbsp;of the full moon, and the sparks drifted to earth in slow motion like the souls of&nbsp;reluctant angels. As that small magnesium sun hovered and blazed, the black&nbsp;pines stepped out of their modest shadows as though previously they had been&nbsp;veiled like virgins but had now decided to be seen as they are in heaven. The&nbsp;drifts of snow pulsed with the incandescence of the absolute chastity of ice, a&nbsp;mortar coughed disconsolately, and an owl whooped. For the first time in my life&nbsp;I shivered physically from something other than the cold; the world had&nbsp;sloughed away its skin and revealed itself as energy and light.&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span>It is my wish to get well so that I can go back to the lines and experience, perhaps for only one more time, that immaculate moment when I saw the face of Gabriel in an instrument of war.&nbsp;</span></blockquote>Quite beautiful.</div>
