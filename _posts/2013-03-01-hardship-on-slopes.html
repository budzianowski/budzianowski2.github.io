The posts may have dried up a tad here at the Corral, but things have been busy for yours truly back in the real world. Most notably going away for our department's annual "strategy meeting" (ahem) in <u><a href="http://www.geilo.no/en/winter/">Geilo</u></a>. It was terrible as the following image will testify to:<br /><br /><img src="http://sphotos-h.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-snc6/285321_10151355434814132_1310683224_n.jpg" /><br /><br />And, if having to break up our invaluable strategy meetings for regular skiing breaks wasn't bad enough, the enigmatic Ms LB arranged for a surprise birthday trip (to a different resort) upon my return. Is there no mercy! The view from our hotel room was equally depressing.<br /><br /><img height="480" src="http://sphotos-h.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-prn1/17723_10151362298869132_17651148_n.jpg" width="640" /><br /><br />I know that I tried to plug the Norwegian PhD previously, so I feel it is only fair to share some of the downsides as well.
