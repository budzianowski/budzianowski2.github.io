<blockquote class="tr_bq"><span>Finally, in some areas at least, Nature seems to show an inexplicable simplicity. This is a brute fact, more or less of a bonus, which if it had not existed could not have been expected. As a result, the working scientist learns as a matter of routine experience that he should have faith that the more beautiful and more simple of two equally (inaccurate) theories will end up being a more accurate describer of wider experience.</span>&nbsp;<br /><br /><span>This bit of luck vouchsafed the theorist should not be pushed too far, for the gods punish the greedy.</span></blockquote><div style="text-align: right;">- Paul Samuelson (<u><a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/1818572"><i>Theory and Realism: A Reply</i></u></a>)</div>
