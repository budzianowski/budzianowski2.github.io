I'm about to go into a pre-exam blogging hibernation, but here are some links to keep you interested:<br /><br />1) Ed Dolan gives a nice overview of the economic issues surrounding <u><a href="http://www.economonitor.com/dolanecon/2012/05/04/fracking-and-the-environment-an-economic-perspective/" target="_blank">fracking and the environment</u></a>. Summary: "<span>As an economist, I see something still different [to fracking critics or industry supporters]: a familiar pattern of  negative externalities and missing market signals, to which the  appropriate response is unlikely to be either prohibition or  laissez-faire.</span>"<br /><br />2) Economic blog comment of the week goes to <u><a href="http://consultingbyrpm.com/blog/2012/04/wenzel-vs.-murphy-you-decide.html#comment-37017" target="_blank">this guy</u></a>: "<span>This was not Netanyahu at the UN.</span>"<br /><br />3) Bryan Caplan draws inspiration from <i>Game of Thrones</i> in writing up <u><a href="http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2012/05/the_bettors_oat.html" target="_blank">The Bettor's Oath</u></a> (<i>a la</i> the Brothers of the Night's Watch).<br /><br />4) Turning to sport, I enjoyed this column by David Moseley on <u><a href="http://www.news24.com/Columnists/DavidMoseley/Screw-Lions-give-us-Kings-20120502" target="_blank">the farce that Super Rugby has become</u></a>. More specifically, the laughable tournament format cooked up by the SANZAR brains trust (a concept that needs to be employed in the loosest possible sense).<br /><br />5) Ever wondered where or how bands got their names? <u><a href="http://www.digitaldreamdoor.com/pages/music0_name.html" target="_blank">Here's a list</u></a> that's worth going through. Lots of cultural homage and sexual innuendo, as you'd expect. Some of the more interesting/unexpected ones for me were <i>Procol Harem</i>, <i>Pulp</i>, <i>Spandau Ballet</i>, and <i>The Replacements</i>. Speaking of which...<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><object class="BLOGGER-youtube-video" classid="clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0" data-thumbnail-src="http://0.gvt0.com/vi/0rO062hjZpA/0.jpg" height="266" width="320"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/0rO062hjZpA&fs=1&source=uds" />      <param name="bgcolor" value="#FFFFFF" />      <embed width="320" height="266"  src="http://www.youtube.com/v/0rO062hjZpA&fs=1&source=uds" type="application/x-shockwave-flash"></embed></object></div><br />And that, ladies and gents, is what we call a stone cold classic.<br /><br />6) UPDATE: Forgot to mention that I've signed <u><a href="http://www.senseaboutscience.org/petition.php" target="_blank">this petition on GMO research</u></a>. You should too, and show your support for science against mind-numbing Luddite prejudices.
