<div style="text-align: justify;"><u><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2010/oct/25/south-africa-solar-power-plant">Very interesting</u></a>:</div><blockquote style="text-align: justify;"><span class="Apple-style-span">South Africa is to unveil plans this week for what it claims will be the world's biggest solar power plant – a radical step in a coal-dependent country where one in six people still lacks electricity.</span></blockquote><blockquote style="text-align: justify;"><span class="Apple-style-span">The project, expected to cost up to R200bn (£18.42bn), would aim by the end of its first decade to achieve an annual output of five gigawatts (GW)</span>*<span class="Apple-style-span"> of electricity - currently one-tenth of South Africa's energy needs.</span></blockquote><blockquote style="text-align: justify;"><span class="Apple-style-span">Giant mirrors and solar panels would be spread across the Northern Cape province, which the government says is among the sunniest 3% of regions in the world with minimal cloud or rain.</span></blockquote><div style="text-align: justify;">Apparently the Dept. of Energy is going on a <u><a href="http://www.engineeringnews.co.za/article/doe-starts-talks-with-investors-on-upington-solar-park-2010-10-28">big investor drive</u></a> to drum up support for the whole shebang. Apart from South Africa's <u><a href="http://www.mg.co.za/article/2010-10-20-feedin-tariff-jumpstart">Renewable Energy Feed-In Tariffs (REFIT) scheme</u></a>&nbsp;- I'm not really in a position to make predictions about the economic implications at this stage... Well, apart from the rather obvious matter that anything requiring a subsidy is going to be more expensive than the current going rate. Still, until we get a carbon price up to internalise the externality costs of coal, I suppose subsidies will have to do to for kick-starting the broader integration of renewables in South Africa and beyond. (Lord knows we could also do with a bit of diversification in the electricity supply down there... And I won't even mention the need to do away with&nbsp;Eskom's crippling monopoly on power supply.)</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">General aversions to monopolies (and certain subsidies) aside, I've been pretty positive about CSP (concentrated solar power) in that part of the country for a while.&nbsp;One concern I do have about these big solar projects though, is that they tend to be in - well - hot and dry places. This becomes problematic given that you need <u><a href="http://www.rivernetwork.org/blog/7/2010/01/07/doe-report-congress-reducing-water-consumption-concentrating-solar-power">pretty substantial amounts of water</u></a> for cooling (with thermal plants) and even cleaning (for&nbsp;photovoltaics). I guess it was inevitable that they've got their eyes set on the <u><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orange_River">Orange River</u></a> for this one... I'm interested to see what the EIA throws up.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">* Unfortunately, the article contains a frustratingly common <u><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watt#Confusion_of_watts.2C_watt-hours.2C_and_watts_per_hour">mistake</u></a> here. The author surely means "<span class="Apple-style-span">5GW of <i>capacity</i></span>"<i>&nbsp;</i>(not output) as the only meaningful way to interpret output is watt hours...&nbsp;It happens again later on when he writes: "<span class="Apple-style-span">South Africa currently consumes 45-48GW of power per year.</span>" (If you're interested, you can visit the reliable <u><a href="http://www.statssa.gov.za/publications/P4141/P4141August2010.pdf">StatsSA</u></a> to see that total electricity consumption in 2009 was the order of 230TWh, i.e. terrawatt hours.)</div>
