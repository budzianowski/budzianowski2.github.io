I've been pleasantly surprised by how popular <u><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2013-01-20-review-extreme-environment-ivo-vegter %}" target="_blank">my review of Ivo Vegter's "Extreme Environment"</u></a> has proven. I initially thought that only a handful of people would care to read something of that length, but less than a week after it was first posted, and it has already garnered several hundred unique page views. (Small change for some, but a decent figure for a humble grad student blogging in relative obscurity.)<br /><div><br /></div><div>While the reception has generally been positive, several commentators appear puzzled by the fact that I still come out with a qualified endorsement after highlighting (what I perceive to be) a number of obvious problems in the book. Some quick responses:</div><div><br /></div><div>1) As I pointed out in my review, despite being highly critical at times, there are parts of the book that I thought were very good. These sections could prove useful to informing public debate.</div><div><br /></div><div>2) I wrote my review in stages. The first part (which generally covers the better, first half of the book) was written just before I flew back from holiday. The remainder came from notes that I made whilst reading on the plane, and just after I arrived back. I think this helped to keep the good and bad separated in my mind, as well as contributing \(-\) I hope \(-\) to a more evenhanded review.</div><div><br /></div><div>3) Similarly, the problem with books of this type is that they tend to be very polarising. I don't think it does justice to the relevant issues if the whole of a book is judged by its weakest parts and summarily dismissed.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>4) Eirik K. asks whether I would be <i>"so forgiving when reading an academic paper?"</i> The short answer to this question, naturally, is no. I don't think this is a fair comparison, though. The margin for error is <i>substantially</i>&nbsp;tighter for journals and academic studies. Moreover, a scientific paper will typically have a fairly narrow focus, while a general interest book like <i>EE&nbsp;</i>covers a much broader spectrum. (To be sure, in the purely&nbsp;hypothetical&nbsp;case where I was asked by Ivo's editor to referee the book before publication, I would have asked for significant revisions. Chiefly to the chapter concerning climate change \(-\) which in its current state would be better omitted altogether \(-\) but in other areas as well.)</div>
