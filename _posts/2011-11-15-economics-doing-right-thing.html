Drowning in university work here, so no time for any blog posts. In the meantime, read this article by <u><a href="http://www.gwagner.com/bio/">Gernot Wagner</u></a>, who has a <u><a href="http://www.amazon.com/But-Will-Planet-Notice-Economics/dp/0809052075/ref=cm_cr_pr_product_top">new book</u></a> out explaining why economic forces and policies \(-\) not individual acts of environmental goodwill or heroism \(-\) are the only way to ensure meaningful action against climate change... and to resolve environmental problems generally.[*]<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><u><a href="http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2011/11/08/free_markets_climate_change"><b>Cold, Hard Economics</b></u></a><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: blue; font-size: x-small;"><br /></span><br /><br /><span class="Apple-style-span">Global warming is happening faster and with more intensity than anyone expected, yet the fossil-fueled right has succeeded in removing the issue almost entirely from the agenda through a false pretense of defending "free markets." In response, environmentalists have tended to retreat further into their own organically padded corners, when what's needed is to get back to economic basics: Markets cannot be free when benefits are privatized and enormous costs are being socialized. The only way out of this environmental crisis is to align citizens' economic self-interest with the planet's health.[...]</span></blockquote><div><div><div>You can also watch a video of Gernot <u><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leGkar14los&amp;feature=share">here</u></a><span id="goog_325493130"></span><span id="goog_325493131"></span><u><a href="http://www.blogger.com/"></u></a>.<br /><br /><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: x-small;">[*] Lest it be unclear, economic policies also include "let prices and the market mechanism run their course". Environmental economics is not simply about knee-jerk, top-down regulation. Although, you already knew that. <u><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2011-04-11-links-market-design-edition %}">Right</u></a>?</span></div></div></div>
