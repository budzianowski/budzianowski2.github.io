At the beginning of last year, I announced a (mostly) informal book challenge that I'm partaking in. The goal of which is to complete <u><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2010-12-31-new-years-resolutions-and-literary %}" target="_blank">six carefully selected "epics"</u></a> before my friend and rival <i>literatus</i>, Bloomsboy[*].<br /><br />Truth to be told, I'm faring pretty&nbsp;disappointingly&nbsp;on that score. Course work and related uni readings have taken over my life. What little spare time I now have is normally spent&nbsp;<strike>trolling the internet</strike>&nbsp;perusing something a shade lighter and, well, shorter.<br /><br />My one consolation in all this is that \(-\) according to my sources[**] \(-\) his own progress has been equally unimpressive. Since he&nbsp;allegedly&nbsp;works for a publishing firm, I don't see what his excuse is...<br /><br />At any rate, it was Bloomsboy who told me a great anecdote not too long ago about one of the five authors in our mandatory set, James Joyce. It concerns his relationship with protégé&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>Waiting for Godot</i> playwright, Samuel Beckett, at the time when&nbsp;failing eyesight had left him dictating his words to others:<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><span>Beckett's mind had a subtlety and strangeness that attracted Joyce as it attracted, in another way, his daughter. [...]Once or twice he dictated a bit of Finnegans Wake to Beckett, though dictation did not work very well for him; in the middle of one such session there was a knock at the door which Beckett didn't hear. Joyce said, `Come in,' and Beckett wrote it down. Afterwards he read back what he had written and Joyce said, `What's that "Come in"?' 'Yes, you said that,' said Beckett. Joyce thought for a moment, then said, `Let it stand.' He was quite willing to accept coincidence as his collaborator.</span></blockquote><div style="text-align: right;">Richard Ellmann, James Joyce (New York, 1959), pp. 661-662.</div><br />In its own small way, the above passage goes some way towards explaining the incomprehensibility of <i><u><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finnegans_Wake" target="_blank">Finnegans Wake</u></a></i>... Perhaps making it a bit more palatable at the same time.<br /><br /><div style="text-align: center;">---</div><span style="font-size: x-small;">[*] Self-styled in a moment of apparent irony.</span><br /><span style="font-size: x-small;">[**] i.e. Bloomsboy.</span>
