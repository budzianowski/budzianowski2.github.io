## About me

I was born and raised in a small Polish city Drezdenko (check out my video of my beautiful neighbourhood area [Notecka forest](https://youtube.com/watch?v=EXHQY0JRl74). My family originally comes from west part of today's Ukraine and Belarus which before 1945 was Polish regions called Pokucie and Polesie respectively.


Last year I started MPhil in Machine Learning, Speech and Language Technology at Cambridge University joining fantastic Clare Hall College. My master thesis was focused on generalizing some methods from statistical physics for training in completely deterministic and unsupervised way deep neural networks. I was supervised by [dr. Rich Turner](http://learning.eng.cam.ac.uk/Public/Turner/Turner) and [Nilesh Tripuraneni](https://mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk/?portfolio=nilesh-tripuraneni). You can play around with this method using my [repo](https://github.com/budzianowski/DBN/).

I continue my studies at Cambridge working in [Dialogue Systems Group](http://mi.eng.cam.ac.uk/research/dialogue/) beign supervised by [dr. Milica Gašić](https://mi.eng.cam.ac.uk/~mg436). 

With [Marta Karaś](https://statsox.github.io/) I created first Polish platform about machine learning [PLML](https://plml17.github.io).


In my free time I play for [Cambridge Volleyball Blues Team](http://cuvc.org) t
