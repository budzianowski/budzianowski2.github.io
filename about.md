I was born and raised in a small Polish city Drezdenko (check out my video of the beautiful neighbourhood area [Notecka forest](https://youtube.com/watch?v=EXHQY0JRl74). My family originally comes from west part of today's Ukraine and Belarus which before 1945 were Polish regions called Pokucie and Polesie respectively.

For my bachelor studies I attended the Poznań University of Economics and Business where I worked under supervision of [dr. Jacek Wallusch](http://ikbt.org/beta/o-nas/) graduating in economics in 2013. After my first year at PUEB, I took mathematics at Adam Mickiewicz Poznań University where I stayed later on and pursued Master's degree under supervision of [prof. Ryszard Doman](https://semopis.wmi.amu.edu.pl/Matematyka/prof.%20dr%20hab.%20Ryszard%20Doman) graduating with first class honours. My [master thesis](https://github.com/budzianowski/budzianowski.github.io/blob/master/data/Pawe%C5%82_Budzianowski.pdf) (in Polish) concerned modelling conditional dependence of long-term multivariate time series using copulas.

Last year I started MPhil in Machine Learning, Speech and Language Technology at Cambridge University joining fantastic Clare Hall College. My master thesis was focused on generalizing some methods from statistical physics for training in completely deterministic and unsupervised way deep neural networks. I was supervised by [dr. Rich Turner](http://learning.eng.cam.ac.uk/Public/Turner/Turner) and [Nilesh Tripuraneni](https://mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk/?portfolio=nilesh-tripuraneni). You can play around with this method using my [repo](https://github.com/budzianowski/DBN/).

I continue my studies at Cambridge working in [Dialogue Systems Group](http://mi.eng.cam.ac.uk/research/dialogue/) being supervised by [dr. Milica Gašić](https://mi.eng.cam.ac.uk/~mg436). I hope to develop some general methods for training long-term conversational agents that will be able to talk in open domain.

With [Marta Karaś](https://statsox.github.io/) I have created first Polish platform about machine learning [PLML](https://plml17.github.io). As we try to promote machine learning in Poland, the whole site is in Polish.

In my free time I play for [Cambridge Volleyball Blues Team](http://cuvc.org), play around with [analog photography](https://wolddecomposition.tumblr.com/), listen to classical music and try to read everything that Dostoyevsky wrote.
